# FeatureImputationHeatFluxDataset
Prediction of x_e_out [-] on Heat Flux Dataset where ~15% of 7 out of 8 features have been nulled (lost) required careful data preparation including imputation of missing data points.

Prediction of x_e_out [-] are made based on the following features:
-	Author
-	Geometry
-	pressure [MPa]
-	mass_flux [kg/m2-s]
-	D_e [mm]
-	D_h [mm]
-	length [mm]
-	chf_exp [MW/m2]
